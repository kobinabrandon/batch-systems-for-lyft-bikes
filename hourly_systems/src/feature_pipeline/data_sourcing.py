"""
Much of the code in this module is concerned with downloading the zip files that 
contain raw data, extracting their contents, and loading said contents as 
dataframes.

In an earlier version of this project, I downloaded the data for every year that 
Divvy has been in operation (from 2014 to date). I have since decided to restrict 
my training data to data from 2024 so that I wouldn't have to deal with the demands 
on my memory and time that preprocessing that data would have required (not to speak
of the training and testing of models).    

With that being said, I'm interested in seeing what a model based on data from say, 
2021 would perform, so I've included code that would allow for that data to be 
downloaded
